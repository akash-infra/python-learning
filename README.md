# 🐍 Python Learning Journey - Akash Sharma

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my **daily learning journey in Python** from beginner to advanced level. I am following the **CodeWithHarry YouTube playlist**, watching **3 videos per day**, and practicing exercises daily.

**Goals:**
- Build strong Python fundamentals
- Solve daily exercises
- Create small projects as I progress
- Become job-ready for AI, Data, and Cloud-related Python applications
